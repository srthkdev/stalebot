# Requirements Document

## Introduction

StaleBot is a GitHub Issue Janitor designed to help open-source maintainers manage stale issues in their repositories. The system monitors GitHub repositories based on user-defined rules and automatically sends email notifications when issues become stale according to specified criteria. This serverless application uses Convex for backend processing, GitHub API for repository monitoring, and Resend for email notifications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to authenticate with GitHub and select repositories to monitor, so that I can manage which projects StaleBot should track.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the application THEN the system SHALL present a GitHub OAuth authentication option
2. WHEN a user completes GitHub authentication THEN the system SHALL fetch and display their accessible repositories
3. WHEN a user selects repositories to monitor THEN the system SHALL store these selections in the database
4. WHEN a user wants to modify their repository selections THEN the system SHALL allow them to add or remove repositories from monitoring
5. IF a user loses access to a repository THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully and notify the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to configure stale issue detection rules, so that I can define what constitutes a stale issue for my projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a rule THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify inactivity duration (e.g., 30 days)
2. WHEN a user creates a rule THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify issue labels to filter by (e.g., 'bug', 'enhancement')
3. WHEN a user creates a rule THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify issue states to monitor (open, closed, all)
4. WHEN a user creates a rule THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify assignee conditions (assigned, unassigned, specific users)
5. WHEN a user saves a rule THEN the system SHALL validate the rule configuration and store it
6. WHEN a user wants to modify rules THEN the system SHALL allow editing and deletion of existing rules
7. IF a rule configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want StaleBot to automatically check for stale issues on a schedule, so that I don't have to manually monitor my repositories.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system runs a scheduled check THEN it SHALL fetch issues from all monitored repositories using the GitHub API
2. WHEN processing issues THEN the system SHALL apply user-defined rules to identify stale issues
3. WHEN an issue matches stale criteria THEN the system SHALL record it for notification processing
4. WHEN API rate limits are encountered THEN the system SHALL handle them gracefully with appropriate backoff strategies
5. WHEN GitHub API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing other repositories
6. IF a repository becomes inaccessible THEN the system SHALL skip it and notify the user
7. WHEN processing completes THEN the system SHALL update the last check timestamp for each repository

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to receive email notifications about stale issues, so that I can take appropriate action to keep my repositories organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN stale issues are identified THEN the system SHALL generate email notifications using the Resend service
2. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL include issue details (title, URL, last activity date, labels)
3. WHEN sending notifications THEN the system SHALL group multiple stale issues from the same repository into a single email
4. WHEN sending emails THEN the system SHALL use the repository owner's email address as the recipient
5. WHEN email delivery fails THEN the system SHALL retry according to Resend component's retry logic
6. WHEN emails are successfully sent THEN the system SHALL track delivery status and update notification records
7. IF a user wants to unsubscribe THEN the system SHALL provide an unsubscribe mechanism in emails

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to view a dashboard of my monitored repositories and recent notifications, so that I can track StaleBot's activity and manage my settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all monitored repositories with their status
2. WHEN displaying repository information THEN the system SHALL show the last check time and number of stale issues found
3. WHEN a user views notification history THEN the system SHALL display recent email notifications with delivery status
4. WHEN a user wants to manage rules THEN the system SHALL provide access to rule configuration from the dashboard
5. WHEN displaying stale issues THEN the system SHALL provide direct links to the GitHub issues
6. WHEN a user wants to manually trigger a check THEN the system SHALL provide a manual refresh option
7. IF there are system errors or issues THEN the dashboard SHALL display relevant status information

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and maintain data integrity, so that the service remains reliable for users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are hit THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff and retry logic
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL handle errors gracefully and maintain data consistency
3. WHEN email sending fails THEN the system SHALL use Resend component's built-in retry and queuing mechanisms
4. WHEN processing large numbers of repositories THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate batching and throttling
5. WHEN user authentication expires THEN the system SHALL prompt for re-authentication
6. WHEN external services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing what's possible
7. IF data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL prevent further processing and alert administrators

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a repository maintainer, I want to configure notification preferences, so that I can control how and when I receive stale issue alerts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets up notifications THEN the system SHALL allow them to specify email frequency (immediate, daily digest, weekly digest)
2. WHEN a user configures preferences THEN the system SHALL allow them to set quiet hours for notifications
3. WHEN a user wants to customize emails THEN the system SHALL allow them to choose email templates or formats
4. WHEN multiple rules trigger for the same issue THEN the system SHALL consolidate notifications to avoid spam
5. WHEN a user wants to pause notifications THEN the system SHALL provide a temporary disable option
6. WHEN notification preferences are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to future notifications
7. IF a user's email bounces THEN the system SHALL pause notifications and alert them through the dashboard
